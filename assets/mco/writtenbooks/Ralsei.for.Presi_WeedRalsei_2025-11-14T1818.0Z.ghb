##
Verico October 2025##
  Presidential Election§r##
>>>>
Vote WeedRalsei for ##
president of Verico ##
during the October ##
2025 election!§r##
>>>>
So far, I have passed ##
a law to bring Verican ##
jobs back to Verican ##
citizens.##
##
This not only brings ##
wealth back to Verico, ##
but also decreases ##
Newport's influence ##
over our small, but ##
still independent, ##
democracy.§r##
>>>>
I have also taken ##
steps to ensure that ##
the Heart of ##
Freedonia will be ##
restored to its former ##
glory.##
The Heart, which was ##
formerly a lush tree ##
with green leaves, ##
ended up loosing the ##
majority of its foliage ##
due to Newport's ##
industrialization.§r##
>>>>
Newport's farms, such ##
as the sand/glass ##
farm, burn thousands ##
of pounds of coal ##
each day.##
To power its massive, ##
mostly empty, ##
skyscrapers, an ##
enormous amount of ##
electricity must be ##
generated, usually by ##
burning coal, lava, or ##
blaze rods.§r##
>>>>
This creates pollution, ##
which is toxic to our ##
beloved tree.##
##
Saving the tree ##
requires a two-part ##
effort:##
##
1. A task force to ##
restore the tree's ##
leaves has already ##
been created and is ##
working tirelessly.§r##
>>>>
However, without ##
preventative steps, ##
Newport's pollution will ##
simply poison the tree ##
again. So, more steps ##
must be taken.##
##
2. Sanctions must be ##
imposed against the ##
Newport empire until ##
they switch to greener ##
energy or shut off ##
power to their§r##
>>>>
unused skyscrapers ##
altogether.##
##
If reelected, I will ##
impose tariffs on all ##
goods from the ##
Newport empire, and ##
strengthen alliances ##
to other nations not ##
affiliated with Newport.§r##
>>>>
I also already planned ##
for a large weed farm ##
to be built in ##
Rosenburg. With this, ##
we can make Verico ##
the cannabis capital of ##
MCO, bringing wealth to ##
our city.##
If demand exists, I will ##
also build facilities ##
that make other drugs ##
as well.§r##
>>>>
So think about it!##
Would you rather want ##
a snek for president, ##
who only has ##
Newport's best ##
interests in mind, or ##
would you want ##
someone who puts ##
Vericans first?§r##
>>>>
Verico for the ##
Vericans, Vericans for ##
Verico!##
