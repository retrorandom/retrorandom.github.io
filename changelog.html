<p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">7/02/2024: Finally decided to get this up and running again obviously its not finished nor will it be finished soon but keep an eye out on this page for updates. I made the website easier for myself to make updates since the old code was a mess and I could never make updates with It. Thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy the new look <3 (some pages may not be finished so dont worry if you see a error)</font><br>
